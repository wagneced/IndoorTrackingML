# IndoorTrackingML
This is an additional project to test if precision of simple indoor tracking can be elevated via machine learning algorithms.
This project should add to the existing projects of bkuehnis and support his solution (bkuehnis/beacon-backend + bkuehnis/beacon-frontend).


TODO: Addition of results as an overview which models leads to which performance.
Also it should contain how the project / code should be runned and data can be processed.

Planned to be added once project is in a later stage
